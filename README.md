4. Aim: 
Kegg Pathway support to debrowser

5. Project description: 
DEBrowser is written in R and deposited to bioconductor. 

In DEBrowser, there is GO Term analysis support. To be able to run any GOTerm analysis, we prepare a genelist. Here prepared genelist is usually up and down regulated genes found by differential expression analysis or selected gene lists obtained interative plots or heatmaps.

Like in GOTerm analysis, we expect running pathway analysis and visualizing it using a bioconductor package. 

Here we will create a page to show Pathways for given gene lists like in GOTerm analysis. 

To be able to do that, please clone debrowser code from bioconductor or github.

Add pages using pathview or any other package. 

Make sure the plots are downloadable.
